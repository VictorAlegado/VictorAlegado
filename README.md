<h1>Hello, I'm Victor! <br/><a>Cyber Security Professional</a>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
I'm a Cyber Security graduate with a background in Information Systems, Cyber Security and Business, accompanied by certifications in CompTIA Security+, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) and Microsoft Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals (SC-900).

<br />
<br />
My professional experience includes an internship at Datacom, where I gained insights from the analysts in the Security Operations Centre by conducting tabletop phishing exercises, SOP development and leveraging tools/frameworks such as SIEM/SOAR/NIST to enhance threat detection and incident response
<br />
<br />
I'm eager to further develop my skills in cybersecurity, particularly within a Security Operations Centre environment. While I have hands-on experience in areas like threat analysis, incident response, and security automation, I‚Äôm excited to expand my knowledge and contribute to a team where I can further grow and develop.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to explore my work, and let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity, cloud security, or threat management.
